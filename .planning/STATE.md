## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| Decision | Phase | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| index.json keyed by absolute path | 01-01 | O(1) lookup for file entries |
| JSON schema with version field | 01-01 | Enables future schema migrations |
| updated=null for initialization | 01-01 | Distinguishes init from update |
| Use heredoc for stdin testing | 01-02 | Pipe chaining has timing issues with async stdin |
| Extract 'default' as export name | 01-02 | Both 'default' and identifier recorded for default exports |
| Read file from disk for Edit tool | 01-02 | Edit only provides old_string/new_string, not full content |

### Pending Todos

- `/gsd:resume-work` decimal phase handling (deferred from v1.8.0)

### Blockers/Concerns

- `.planning/` is gitignored in GSD repo - intel files created but not committed (expected for project-local data)
